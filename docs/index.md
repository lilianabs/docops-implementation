# Tutorial

In this tutorial we describe an implementation of Docs as Code. First, we define what Docs as Code is and describe the process that we follow to develop documentation. Then, we list the tools that we use and we go through the process of configuring each one of them for this implementation.

## What is Docs as Code?

Docs as Code is treating documentation as a software product. We use the same tools that are used in software development—IDE, Git, and CI/CD—to write and publish a project's documentation. Also, we use the same tools that software developers use. As a result, we deliver the documentation in the same way we deliver software.

## How is the Process of Docs as Code?

To deliver documentation as code, we follow a similar workflow as software development.
