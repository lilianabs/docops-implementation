# docops-implementation

This repository contains an implementation of [Docs as Code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) using the following tools:

* **Markdown:** Create our documents as plain text files and use a Markup language.
* **VS Code:** Use an IDE to edit our documents. 
* **Mkdocs:** Use a static site generator. 
* **GitHub:** Use Git for file management and collaboration.
* **HTMLProofer and Vale:** Test our documentation. We check for missing links and use a prose linter.
* **GitHub Actions:** Build and publish the documentation site continuously.

The static site is deployed to Netlify in the following (URL)[https://zen-kowalevski-471906.netlify.app/].
